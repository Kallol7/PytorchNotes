Pretrained:
- The folder "Pretrained" contains a demo on how to load a Pytorch pre-trained model from Hugging Face and retrain it. Change model structure accordingly. If you compare the notebooks "Pretrained.ipynb" and "Pretrained_Same_Domain.ipynb", you will find that it is always better to find a pre-trained model of the same domain rather than using the latest generalistic pre-trained model.
